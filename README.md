## History

7 Feb 2023
- [x] Access the Research LUMC platform.
- [x] LMM: residual analysis based on full model (include two-way interactions).
- [x] Time dependent cox regression (survival package).
- [ ] Time dependent cox regression (INLA)

2 Feb 2023
- [x] Find patients whose AR grade dropped during follow-up.
- [x] Find outliers of each variable.
- [x] Fix errors when using 'xyplot'.
- [x] Residual analysis for LMM.
- [x] Build summary table on GitHub.
- [ ] Tried joint modeling in the JM package. - Failed due to NAs.
- [ ] Tried to build a LMM with ideal marginal residuals. - Linear trend in residuals at this moment.
